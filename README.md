# MySQL to SleekDB Export
### Attention my dear friend:
This tool is a first version, it will surely give you more love in the next versions. But don't panic, do what it says to do.
This is the first export tool for SleekDB. An excellent project by "Ratik" which I have taken with affection since it is truly a great project.
This tool was born with my need to want to export different MySQL databases and test the performance of SleekDB with a large volume of information. It turned out to be perfect ... Both products, of course.
This is why I decided to share the experiment for those who require this.
