# MySQL to SleekDB Export
### Attention my dear friend
This tool is a first version, I will surely give it more love in the next versions. But don't panic, this tool does what it says.

This is the first export tool for SleekDB, an excellent "Ratik" project, a project that I have taken up with love.

This tool was born with my need to want to export different MySQL databases and test the performance of SleekDB with a large volume of information, which turned out to be perfect... both products, of course.

That is why I decided to share the experiment for those who require it.
